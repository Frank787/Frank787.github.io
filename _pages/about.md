I'm an experienced data intensive professional/leader in IT at strategic, tactical and operational levels, encompassing 
multiple domains including warehousing, project management, descriptive/predictive analytics, data/database 
management, reporting and forecasting. Also have managed and contributed to multiple projects directly experiencing the challenges 
and successes of global transformations in highly matrixed and geographically dispersed environments. Regularly coordinate and collaborate with multiple 
domain subject matter experts to improve processes and resolve business critical issues in dynamic engagements. I seek the opportunity 
to lead/participate in projects that afford me the ability to be challenged in responsibilities, multitasking and interaction with other analytic and IT professionals and stakeholders who have the same passion and results oriented attitude to fully succeed with a progressive data driven organization. Moreover, initially was part of user community and have the empathy, diplomacy, negotiation and listening skills necessary for change to be seamlessly integrated.
